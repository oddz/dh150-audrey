# DH150 Assignment 6: Low-Fidelity Prototype by Audrey Yao

## Project Description

This project seeks to alleviate some of the stress of everyday life by providing a space for users to track all their responsibilites and accompanying tasks. With the decades-old rise of technology, it is no longer feasible to record to-dos with pen and paper. A virtual platform would remove the need to manually record and roll-over tasks, provide a space for all events to be consolidated, and  ensure that users always have access to the information they need. 

The target community would be those who have too much on their plate to keep track of mentally - such as students and working adults. Expected users also value organization, and enjoy the feeling of productivity that comes along with checking a task off of a to-do list. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test how well the current system flows from a user's perspective, so that changes can be made in order increase the usability of the product. 

### Tasks 

I chose some common tasks that would exercise some of the main features of the application: adding a task, making a list, and utilizing the calendar.

1) Input a homework assignment

2) Create a grocery list

3) Check off a task in calendar view 

## Wireframes & Wireflows

The prototype was designed in order to make the application as easy to understand and utilize as possible. On the homepage, users can view all their current and upcoming tasks, providing easy access to check off completed work. Three options are offered in the top navigation bar in the form of a pencil icon, a book icon, and a calendar icon: create a task, make a list, and view calendar, respectively. 

If the pencil is tapped, a window appears to allow users to input all the needed information to add a new task. If the book is tapped, a window appears to allow users to input all the needed information to create a new list. If the calendar is tapped, the users are brought to a view of all their previously inputted tasks in a calendar form. Users can also place all their tasks and lists into specific categories, so that all entries can be kept organized on the main task & list pages.

### Task 1: Inputting Assignment

This interaction went a bit differently than expected. The user choose the correct icon, the pencil in the top left corner, and was led to the menu to create a new task. However, when she was told to add the tasks into a category ("homework"), she was confused on how to do so. After being led to tap the "category" option, the user was able to successful input the category and exit the window by tapping "done". 

### Task 2: Creating List

This interaction also went a bit differently than expected. In the prototype, there are several pathways to creating a list - users can create a new task and add a new list through the "attachments" menu, or they can create a new list directly by tapping the book icon in the top navigation bar. The user began by clicking the new task icon, but was able to add a list the way the system intends. Rather than clicking "add attachment", the user inputted the list directly into the description box of the new task.

### Task 3: Utilizing Calendar

This interaction was quick, and went as expected. The user was able to quickly identify the calendar icon in the top right corner and navigate successfully to the calendar view of all inputted tasks.

## Reflection

Overall, the process was not terrible. Though the user missed several steps that was included in the prototype, she still reached the intended end screen for every tasks. The skipping of steps may also be attributed to my own shortcomings in terms of explaining the task and goal clearly. 

There were several areas that seemed to confuse the user, which I would seek to correct in my next iteration of the prototype.

For the first feature - creating tasks - I would minimize confusion over entering a "category" by making it a more prominent part of the new-task menu. The way that it is formatted currently may be easily missed by users, which would lead to a cluttered homepage. For the second feature - creating list - I would replace the current "new list" icon with something more intuitive, so that users would find it easier to identify the option. I would also consider making a list option an inherent part of the task "description" box, so that it is more integrrated.
