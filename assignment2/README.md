# DH150 Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing by Audrey Yao

### Introduction

Notion is an application and web program that provides a highly customizable workspace for users to track notes, tasks, databases, and much more. Users must first create an account using either their Gmail or Apple ID in order to access the app. Any pages created will be saved on the account, allowing the information to be available on any device that the application can be downloadeded on or accessed on. Users can choose from a variety of pre-made, editable templates, or choose instead to design their own pages froms scratch. 

### Purpose of Usability Testing

The purpose of usability testing is to improve the usability of the product. This is done by observing real users as they utilize the actual product to work through tasks and functions. The ease at which users can achieve the goals assigned during the test informs the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction rate of the product. Through usability testing, we can uncover the key problems that users run into while navigating the product, and work to eliminate these issues to improve the usefulness of the design, rid of any potential frustrations, and - in turn - improve profitability. 

Based on my findings of the heuristic evaluation on Notion, I choose to test the effectiveness of the application's design, the flexibility & efficency of use, and the ability to find help & documentation. I had previously found that the large amount of functions & features woven into the app may make it look difficult to use. The lack of an editing tab and a confusing navigation bar may hinder users' ability to move from page to page. Furthermore, the lack of access to technical support may frustrate users when they are unable to complete desired tasks. I designed three task scenarios to observe each of these potential issues.

### Methodology 

Usability tests are conducted in calm, quiet environments. It starts off with the moderator introducing the testing process to the participant. After a thorough explaination, the participant signs an informed consent form and answers some background questions. The moderator then guides the participant through some pre-test questions about the product. After that, they are assigned imaginary task scenarios to complete, in order to test the usability of the product within a real-world setting. This is followed by a post-test questionarire that gauges how the participants feels, now that they have gotten the chance to use the product. They will also choose five words from a list to describe the product, as well as answer some product satisfaction questions. Finally, the participant will provide their demographics information, which would remain confidential. 

With this year's unique online setting, I conducted the pilot usability test over Zoom. Since the program I am testing is an app, my participant(s) shared their tablet screen, and I utilized Zoom's built in recording feature to document the test. Other than these adjustments, the rest of the UT process remained unchanged. The entire process took about twenty minutes.

### Reflection 

I learned a lot from conducting the pilot usability test, about the usability of the Notion app & about the UT process itself. Regarding Notion, I found that my participant(s) were initially intimidated by the applcation interface. They found it difficult to utilize specific functions assigned in the task scenarios, such as creating lists, editing text, and adding sub-pages. They also struggled in navigating from page-to-page. These issues could be addressed by re-designing the navigation tools and simplifying the features in order to make the interface more usable. 

I ran into some issues throughout the test. The most major one was that for the first user that I conducted on, I neglected to share the screen on Zoom, so I was not able to record the participant's progress as she filled out the survey. Although I have the recording of her facial expressions, a screen-recording of her navigation through the Notion app, and her final submission response, it would have been optimal to have recorded her survey as well, rather than just documneting the audio. Due to this, I choose to conduct the UT process for a second time, on a different participant. Both of them are linked in the folder above, but the mishap was quite unfortunate. In addition, during the second test, there were several interruptions in the form of background noise on my end. I did not want to pause the test, so I choose to mute myself whenever the participant was speaking, so that the noise would not derail his train of thought. In the future, I would ensure that the space would be quiet prior to conducting the test. 

All in all, garnering more experience with conducting usability tests, and making the effort to check that all the equipment is operating as desired would improve UT for me in the future. But, despite the mishaps, it was a great experience!
