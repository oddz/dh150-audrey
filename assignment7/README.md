# DH150 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype by Audrey Yao

## Project Description 

This project aims to provide a space for busybodies and perfectionists to keep track of their ongoing tasks, responsibilities, and interests. Hopefully, it would provide an easy alternative to inconvenient planners and complicated applications. 

First, I put together the screens on Figma based off of my low-fidelity sketches and the feedback I received on them. Then, I had a user navigate through the system, so that I could gain additional feedback. The purpose of this prototyping phase is to evaluate the functionality and usefulness of the designs. This phase is extremely useful, as it provides a way to test out a tangible system, and corrections can be made directly to the design based off of the feedback.
