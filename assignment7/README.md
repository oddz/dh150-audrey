# DH150 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype by Audrey Yao

## Project Description 

This project aims to provide a space for busybodies and perfectionists to keep track of their ongoing tasks, responsibilities, and interests. Hopefully, it would provide an easy alternative to inconvenient planners and complicated applications. 

The purpose of this prototyping phase is to evaluate the functionality of the designs. This phase is extremely useful, as it provides a way to visualize and test out a tangible system, and corrections can be made directly to the design based off of the feedback. I aim to get a better sense of what users liked & what they struggled with, in order to improve the final product and provide the most intuitive design possible. I designed this prototype with Figma, making use of previous feedback I received on my low-fidelity prototype. 

The current screens display the designs that users see when they: 

- View their upcoming tasks 
- Add a new task entry
- Look at their monthly calendar spread

### Design Description

For the graphical interface design, I strove to keep it as simple and succinct as possible. I want to keep the learning curve small and avoid overloading users with information, especially since users would likely experience enough stress merely by looking at their upcoming tasks. On this same note, I choose to utilize neutral colors due to its calming effects. I drew inspiration from past applications I have enjoyed using, and kept the screen design minimal and modern. 

#### Color Scheme

Initially, I was shooting for a much lighter overall theme, but the colors that I originally choose did not pass the accessibility test. I chose to keep the background color that I wanted (#FBF5E3), and changed up the text color until I found one that I believed fit the aesthetics and theme (#75694A). This combination yielded a 4:97:1 contrast ratio. I also interspersed another neutral color (#8D712A) with white in order to provide some variety. This combination yielded a 4:63:1 contrast ratio.

## Feedback

I reached out to a friend in order to get their first impression & feedback on the initial prototype. I was surprised when he compared it to the notes application (which is pre-installed into Apple products), but after some thought, I can see the similarities in design. In the next iteration, I will make some changes - likely in color and formatting - so that there are minimal similarities. The user also pointed out some elements that he would like to see implemented, such as adding a time function to the new task entry page and remaking the calendar view, which I will definitely keep in mind when I am arranging the next set of screens.
