# DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Audrey Yao

## Task-Tracking Tools

#### As students with packed schedules, task-tracking tools are essential to maintaining order in our everyday lives. I am constantly on the lookout for new applications and programs to try out, especially ones that can replicate the feeling of jotting notes down in a planner.

## Heuristic Evaluation of App - Notion

### #1. Visibility of System Status 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>When the app starts up, it displays Notion's logo for as long as it takes to load the user's homepage. It would be more effective to display some kind of progress indicator, so that the user knows that the app is loading rather than frozen.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #2. Match Between System & Real World

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The actions icon can be changed to one that is more commonly understood, as opposed to a "..."</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #3. User Control & Freedom

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>The "undo" and "redo" options are limited to the page that the user is editing on. Once the user leaves the page, the changes are saved and the "undo" and "redo" options no longer apply.</td>
</table>


### #4. Consistency & Standards

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The search button is located on the bottom left rather than the top right, as is consistent within a majority of apps.</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Instead of a search, the top right is occupied with a "share/invite" function, which is of lesser importance.</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Swiping to the right sometimes brings up the navigation menu, and sometimes brings users back to the previous page. The lack of consistency with the gesture may lead users to partake in actions that they do not mean to do.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #5. Error Prevention

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>There is no confirmation for deleting a page. Regardless of how much information the page contains, once a user presses delete, the page will dissapear without asking the user if they are sure with their decision.</td>
     <td>3</td>
    <td>Rather than employing an "edit" button, tapping anywhere on a page's text automatically brings users into editing mode. This is inefficient, and accidental taps may prove frustrating as it will consistently bring users back to edit mode, even if they are simply trying to scroll.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>The app offers a variety of page templates that users can use, allowing them to create aesthetically pleasing pages without having to memorize all of the application's functions. It also displays all past searches, and allows an in-app "remember password" feature.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>The display of pages, sub-pages, sub-sub-pages, and so forth within the navigation bar does not display all the folders that the users has opened. Rather than displaying "...", which then shows all the folders once clicked, it would be more effective to show all the open folders within the navigation bar, and employ some sort of scroll in order to maximize space.</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>There is no clear way to confirm changes after a user has finished editing a page, causing confusion over whether or not the edits are saved. The addition of a "check" icon or a "done" button would be useful.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #8. Aesthetic &  Minimalist Design

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Since customization is an integral part of the application, users are able to design their pages however they see fit. The structure of the app itself is minimalistic, with only the essentials features displayed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #9. Helps Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>If the app does not recognize your email and/or password, it does not specify which of the categories are incorrect.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #10. Help & Documentation

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>There is no initial tour that guides first-time users through navigating the application. The wide variety of functions and options may overwhelm users, and the lack of guidance may dissuade them from continuing with the application.</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>There is no help center linked directly within the app. In order to access the help center, users must go onto the Notion webpage to search for answers. It would be more effective to have the help center linked directly within the app so that users don't have to move to an external link for their inquiries.</td>
  </tr>
