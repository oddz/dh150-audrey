# DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Audrey Yao

## Task-Tracking Tools

#### Task-tracking tools are essential to maintaining order in our everyday lives. With the rise of new technologies, it is no longer feasible to painstakingly record your ever-changing schedule with pen and paper. I am constantly on the lookout for new applications and programs to try out, especially ones that can replicate the feeling of jotting notes down in a planner. I have chosen to focus on two apps in particular, Notion and Todoist. By improving the UX Design, both programs can become more efficient in aiding users to reach their goals.

## Heuristic Evaluation of App - Notion

https://www.notion.so/

Notion is a versatile program that provides a workspace for recording and tracking notes, tasks, databases, and more. It provides a skeleton for users to create and customize their own pages, with simple drag and drop movements and the ability to add images, website urls, and codes! The program has both desktop and mobile applications, though I will be focusing on the mobile application. 

Though the website offers quite a bit of assistance and guidance, the mobile app does not live up to the same standards. First time users would be easily overwhelmed by the huge variety of functions and customization tools, since there is a lack of a direct help center. The mobile app seems to designed exactly like the desktop one, which is inefficient considering the platform's differences. The abscence of a button that switches on editing mode also proves confusing, as tapping anywhere on the page automatically brings users into editing.

### #1. Visibility of System Status 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>When the app starts up, it displays Notion's logo for as long as it takes to load the user's homepage. It would be more effective to display some kind of progress indicator, so that the user knows that the app is loading rather than frozen.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #2. Match Between System & Real World

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The actions icon can be changed to one that is more commonly understood, as opposed to a "..."</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #3. User Control & Freedom

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>The "undo" and "redo" options are limited to the page that the user is editing on. Once the user leaves the page, the changes are saved and the "undo" and "redo" options no longer apply.</td>
</table>


### #4. Consistency & Standards

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The search button is located on the bottom left rather than the top right, as is consistent within a majority of apps.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Instead of a search, the top right is occupied with a "share/invite" function, which is of lesser importance.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Swiping to the right sometimes brings up the navigation menu, and sometimes brings users back to the previous page. The lack of consistency with the gesture may lead users to partake in actions that they do not mean to do.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #5. Error Prevention

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>There is no confirmation for deleting a page. Regardless of how much information the page contains, once a user presses delete, the page will dissapear without asking the user if they are sure with their decision.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>3</td>
    <td>Rather than employing an "edit" button, tapping anywhere on a page's text automatically brings users into editing mode. This is inefficient, and accidental taps may prove frustrating as it will consistently bring users back to edit mode, even if they are simply trying to scroll.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>The app offers a variety of page templates that users can use, allowing them to create aesthetically pleasing pages without having to memorize all of the application's functions. It also displays all past searches, and allows an in-app "remember password" feature.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>The display of pages, sub-pages, sub-sub-pages, and so forth within the navigation bar does not display all the folders that the users has opened. Rather than displaying "...", which then shows all the folders once clicked, it would be more effective to show all the open folders within the navigation bar, and employ some sort of scroll in order to maximize space.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>There is no clear way to confirm changes after a user has finished editing a page, causing confusion over whether or not the edits are saved. The addition of a "check" icon or a "done" button would be useful.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #8. Aesthetic &  Minimalist Design

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Since customization is an integral part of the application, users are able to design their pages however they see fit. The structure of the app itself is minimalistic, with only the essentials features displayed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #9. Helps Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>If the app does not recognize your email and/or password, it does not specify which of the categories are incorrect.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #10. Help & Documentation

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>There is no help center linked directly within the app. In order to access the help center, users must go onto the Notion webpage to search for answers. It would be more effective to have the help center linked directly within the app so that users don't have to move to an external link for their inquiries.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>There is no initial tour that guides first-time users through navigating the application. The wide variety of functions and options may overwhelm users, and the lack of guidance may dissuade them from continuing with the application.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Heuristic Evaluation of App - Todoist

https://todoist.com/app/

Todoist is provides a space for everyday tracking of tasks, deadlines, reminders, and due dates. Users are able to create seperate "projects" and categories for their tasks, and even assign "priorities" and "filters" to each one for maximum organization. for recording and tracking notes, tasks, databases, and more. The program also has both desktop and mobile applications, and again, I will be focusing on the mobile application. 

The application is quite simple and intuitive, making it easy for first-time users to integrate. However, the lack of a calendar function makes task visualization  difficult. With the rather small amount of features, a task-tracking application like Todoist should allow users to see their due dates laid out on the screen, rather than through a variety of filters.

### #2. Match Between System & Real World

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The "priority" labels are all colored blue, which gives off the impression that they are all of the same importance. It would be more effective to color it by a more widely known system, such as red, yellow, and green.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #3. User Control & Freedom

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>There are no "undo" or "redo" options. If an unneeded task is created, users must navigate to it manually and deleted it. If an unfinished tasks is accidentally checked off, there is no way to recover the information.</td>
</table>


### #4. Consistency & Standards

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Swiping right on a tasks brings up a scheduling menu. This is ineffective, as it would be more intuitive for this action to lead to a general editing menu, which would allow scheduling within it.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #5. Error Prevention

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Users can only choose to display all their tasks in a list format. There is no option to view by calendar or limit it to solely upcoming events.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Once in the editing mode for a task, there is no way to navigate around the rest of the app without discarding the current task being edited. Allowing users to move the task to the side for the time being would be more effective.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #8. Aesthetic &  Minimalist Design

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The inclusion of general categories, as well "projects", "labels", and "filters" all along the side navigation bar may be confusing for users, as labels and filters can all be applied to projects. Allowing users to customize the sidebar as desired would improve the design and allow users greater freedom in organizing their tasks.</td>
