## Heuristic Evaluation of App - Notion

### #1. Visibility of System Status 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>When the app starts up, it displays Notion's logo for as long as it takes to load the user's homepage. It would be more effective to display some kind of progress indicator, so that the user knows that the app is loading rather than frozen.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

    <tr>
    <td>3</td>
