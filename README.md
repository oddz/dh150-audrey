# DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Audrey Yao

## Task-Tracking Tools

#### As students with packed schedules, task-tracking tools are essential to maintaining order in our everyday lives. I am constantly on the lookout for new applications and programs to try out, especially ones that can replicate the feeling of jotting notes down in a planner.

## Heuristic Evaluation of App - Notion

### #1. Visibility of System Status 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>When the app starts up, it displays Notion's logo for as long as it takes to load the user's homepage. It would be more effective to display some kind of progress indicator, so that the user knows that the app is loading rather than frozen.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #2. Match Between System & Real World

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The actions icon can be changed to one that is more commonly understood, as opposed to a "..."</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #3. User Control & Freedom

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>The "undo" and "redo" options are limited to the page that the user is editing on. Once the user leaves the page, the changes are saved and the "undo" and "redo" options no longer apply.</td>
</table>


### #4. Consistency & Standards

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The search button is located on the bottom left rather than the top right, as is consistent within a majority of apps.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Instead of a search, the top right is occupied with a "share/invite" function, which is of lesser importance.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Swiping to the right sometimes brings up the navigation menu, and sometimes brings users back to the previous page. The lack of consistency with the gesture may lead users to partake in actions that they do not mean to do.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #5. Error Prevention

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>There is no confirmation for deleting a page. Regardless of how much information the page contains, once a user presses delete, the page will dissapear without asking the user if they are sure with their decision.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>3</td>
    <td>Rather than employing an "edit" button, tapping anywhere on a page's text automatically brings users into editing mode. This is inefficient, and accidental taps may prove frustrating as it will consistently bring users back to edit mode, even if they are simply trying to scroll.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>The app offers a variety of page templates that users can use, allowing them to create aesthetically pleasing pages without having to memorize all of the application's functions. It also displays all past searches, and allows an in-app "remember password" feature.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>The display of pages, sub-pages, sub-sub-pages, and so forth within the navigation bar does not display all the folders that the users has opened. Rather than displaying "...", which then shows all the folders once clicked, it would be more effective to show all the open folders within the navigation bar, and employ some sort of scroll in order to maximize space.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>There is no clear way to confirm changes after a user has finished editing a page, causing confusion over whether or not the edits are saved. The addition of a "check" icon or a "done" button would be useful.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #8. Aesthetic &  Minimalist Design

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Since customization is an integral part of the application, users are able to design their pages however they see fit. The structure of the app itself is minimalistic, with only the essentials features displayed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #9. Helps Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>If the app does not recognize your email and/or password, it does not specify which of the categories are incorrect.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #10. Help & Documentation

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>There is no help center linked directly within the app. In order to access the help center, users must go onto the Notion webpage to search for answers. It would be more effective to have the help center linked directly within the app so that users don't have to move to an external link for their inquiries.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>There is no initial tour that guides first-time users through navigating the application. The wide variety of functions and options may overwhelm users, and the lack of guidance may dissuade them from continuing with the application.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Heuristic Evaluation of App - Todoist

### #1. Visibility of System Status 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Whenever the system is loading, a circle displays the progress, allowing users to be aware of the amount of time they can anticipate waiting.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #2. Match Between System & Real World

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The "priority" labels are all colored blue, which gives off the impression that they are all of the same importance. It would be more effective to color it by a more widely known system, such as red, yellow, and green.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #3. User Control & Freedom

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>There are no "undo" or "redo" options. If an unneeded task is created, users must navigate to it manually and deleted it. If an unfinished tasks is accidentally checked off, there is no way to recover the information.</td>
</table>


### #4. Consistency & Standards

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Swiping right on a tasks brings up a scheduling menu. This is ineffective, as it would be more intuitive for this action to lead to a general editing menu, which would allow scheduling within it.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #5. Error Prevention

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Once a tasks is checked off, the entire entry dissapears. There is no archive nor any type of record in which users you can check completed tasks. </td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>The app's simple design makes navigating it quite intuitive and easy, with a minimal cognitive load.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Users can only choose to display all their tasks in a list format. There is no option to view by calendar or limit it to solely upcoming events.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Once in the editing mode for a task, there is no way to navigate around the rest of the app without discarding the current task being edited. Allowing users to move the task to the side for the time being would be more effective.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #8. Aesthetic &  Minimalist Design

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The inclusion of general categories, as well "projects", "labels", and "filters" all along the side navigation bar may be confusing for users, as labels and filters can all be applied to projects. Allowing users to customize the sidebar as desired would improve the design and allow users greater freedom in organizing their tasks.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #9. Helps Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Once a project is deleted, there is no recovery option, trash folder, or archive in which users can retrieve it in the event of an accidental erasure.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### #10. Help & Documentation

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rating</th>
    <th>Analysis</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>There is no help center linked directly within the app. In order to access the help center, users must go onto the Todoist webpage to search for answers.
