# DH150 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry by Audrey Yao

## Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
It would support users in successfully tracking deadlines and information. It would provide a consolidated space to record everything within their daily lives, including events, assignments, lists, and so forth.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
A clean and conlidated task-tracking & information recording system would allow users to stay organized in every aspect, and ensure that all their responsibilities are fulfilled on time. In addition, being able to check off tasks give users a feeling of accomplishment and allows them to feel productive. 

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
In terms of physical methods, planners are commonly utilized for task-tracking, event recording, and general list-making. There are also several similarly functioning applications out on the digital market, though they all seem to serve different purposes rather than offering one consolidated option.

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology?
With digital technology, users are allowed easy access. They would be able to view tasks, deadlines, and lists no matter where they are, instead of having to physically tote around a bulky planner. In addition, being able to log tasks virtually essentially creates a permanent log that users can go back and view if needed. Since everything would be recorded online, there is no possibility of losing information, which is a risk when using physical planners. Digital technology also makes editing existing entries and visual categorization easier - no need for white-out or highlighters anymore!

## Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?
##### Demographics
* Students (High-School, College, Graduate)
* Working adults 
* Stay-at-home parents 
##### Preferences
* Organized or enjoys staying organized
* Follows some sort of schedule
##### Expertise
* No sort of expertise needed

#### Where would the users do that activity?
Users can add tasks, events, or other information onto their chosen platform basically anywhere. With a physical method, they can do so as long as they have some sort of paper and writing utensil on hand. With a digital method, users can simply log onto their device and add or remove information wherever they'd like. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
In order to add information onto their chosen platform, users would either have to physically record information, or enter it into some sort of application  to eventually check it off. 

## Research Methods 

For my research methods, I decided to use an interview and participatory observation.

The interview was conducted in the user's home. I used Zoom to record the session. Since task-tracking and information recording occurs virtually anywhere, the user had no problems in terms of accessing her normal tools during the participatory observation section.

For participatory observation, I asked the user to input a new entry onto one of her task lists for the task-tracking application that she currently uses, which is Google Sheets. In order to give the most authenic view, the participant shared her own screen and gave a virtual tour through the sheet before adding an entry, talking through each category as she did so.

## Reflection

This activity was fun to conduct! It felt more like a genuine conversation than anything else, since it asked for the user's personal opinions and habits, as opposed to asking about their opinion on an application. However, since it was so conversation-like, it was easy to get off track. I found myself asking questions that weren't necessarily listed on the script, just to delve deeper into the participant's thought process. It took conscious effort to steer back to the original question. In addition, my participant's responses often answered multiple questions, so I had to jump abruptly to the next section several times. One thing that surprised me was that she mentioned - unprompted - the app that I analyzed for assignmnent one's heuristic evaluation! She mentioned that she did not like it, and ended up pointing out several flaws with the product that matched up with some of the faults that I agreed with, and had initially listed. It was an interesting & insightful coincidence. Next time, I will be sure to map out questions for every scenario, to ensure that I don't stray off track from the main topic. I will also be sure to make more of an effort to foster natural conversation with the participant when steering back to the questions.
