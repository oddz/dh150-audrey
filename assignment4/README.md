# DH150 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry by Audrey Yao

## Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
It would support users in successfully tracking deadlines and information. It would provide a consolidated space to record everything within their daily lives, including events, assignments, lists, and so forth.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
A clean and conlidated task-tracking & information recording system would allow users to stay organized in every aspect, and ensure that all their responsibilities are fulfilled on time. In addition, being able to check off tasks give users a feeling of accomplishment and aloows them to feel productive. 

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
In terms of physical methods, planners are commonly utilized for task-tracking, event recording, and general list-making. There are also several similarly functioning applications out on the digital market, though they all seem to serve different purposes rather than offering one consolidated option.

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology?
With digital technology, users are allowed easy access. They would be able to view tasks, deadlines, and lists no matter where they are, instead of having to physically tote around a bulky planner. In addition, being able to log tasks virtually essentially creates a permanent log that users can go back and view if needed. Since everything would be recorded online, there is no possibility of losing information, which is a risk when using physical planners. Digital technology also makes editing existing entries and visual categorization easier - no need for white-out or highlighters anymore!
