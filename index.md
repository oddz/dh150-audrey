# NOTEIST

### design statement

Organization is an essential skill needed to maintain order in life, for everything from tracking mundane daily tasks like grocery shopping, to jotting down assignments, to recording your favorite movies. This necessity can be aided by task-tracking tools, like planners and digital applications. And with the rise of new and ever-changing technologies, it is no longer required to painstakingly record schedules and task lists with pen and paper. Digital applications make task-tracking easy, convenient, and satisfying. 

Currently, few task-tracking tools available on the market provide efficiency, ease-of-use, and consolidation across multiple applications. I seek to remedy this problem and design an ideal application that I could see everyone - from overscheduled students, to busy moms, to myself - using. The goal of this project is to create an application that would fill in these gaps, and provide a simple and effective outlet for the universal need of task-tracking. 

### competitor analysis

To get a more holistic view of task-trackers, I conducted heuristic evaluations on two digital applications: Notion and Todoist. I chose these programs because they are quite popular and often recommended, but also because I have personal experience using - and ultimately abandoning - them. By evaluating the two through utilization of the ten usability heuristics, I hoped to narrow down exactly what the applications are lacking. This way, I could dive into finding solutions for these issues and avoid possible problems in the application I was creating. 

From evaluating the two applications, I was able to zero in on some of the issues that had previously led me to personally abandon use. This included overly complicated designs as well as a lack of important features, such as calendar viewing and the ability to transfer & consolidate information across other applications.

Next, I conducted usability testing on two participants and guided them through completing several tasks on Notion, arguably one of the most popular digital organizers on the market. From the tests, I found that users were intimidated by the application interface, and expressed difficulty utilizing some of the functions. The tests aided me in ideating features for my own design, and reminded me to prize simplicity and ease of use.

### user research

After conducting the competitor analysis and usability tests, I had a lot of ideas on how to improve existing programs. Next, I sought to learn more about what users would expect when utilizing general task-tracking applications. I wanted to gain insight on how potential users currently deal with organization, what they find to be missing from their routine, and what they would want and need if they were to make the switch to a new digital application. Additionally, I was curious to see if their desired features matched up with my own. 

For my user research, I chose to utilize participatory observation and interviews. I interviewed a friend, whom I personally know to always be balancing a packed schedule. In addition to general inquiries, I asked her to walk me through her task-tracking process, and to discuss some of the methods/programs that she currently uses. From the conversation, I was able to glean more information about a typical user's needs and desires, which I used to inform my application ideation and features.

### user personas

In order to delve deeper into user perspective, I developed several user personas and scenarios. This is crucial in the process of understanding users past surface-level, as it allows us to get a glimpse of their motivations, behavior, and actions. By shifting our perspective into that of a user, we can also attempt to understand the reasoning behind why they may choose a certain program or desire certain features, allowing us to garner more insights to improve the product.

Drawing from my user research, I crafted several personas who would benefit from a digital task-tracking application. I sought to include different backgrounds in order to demonstrate different needs and goals, so that the personas would inform a universally beneficial application.

### wireframe & graphic design 

Based on all my user research and evaluations, I ideated three essential features for the application. 

1. A "new task" button, which would allow users to jot down new tasks and separate them into specific categories. 
2. A "new list" button, which would allow users to itemize information.
3. A "calendar" button, which would allow users to view their tasks and events in a calendar format. 

While sketching out the wireframes, I focused on keeping the design simple and easy to understand. I wanted it to be accessible to everyone regardless of technological expertise, yet still pleasant to look at and fun to use.

### low-fidelity prototype

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57603794/99461476-c0f80180-28e6-11eb-8769-a5dfef35db0d.jpg" width="300" height="400"/> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57603794/99464364-ce17ef00-28ec-11eb-9184-1b0c9a5155b3.jpg" width="300" height="400"/>

Drawing from these features, I sketched out further screen designs and outlined user flows. This step is essential, as ideas can finally be translated into an organized and much more tangible format. I sought to ensure that all the different screens had a logical connection, so that users would easily be able to understand the system. 

I crafted a home screen to display upcoming tasks, a screen to display all lists, a "new task" screen, a "new list" screen, and a calendar viewing screen.

With these screens, I created three possible tasks to test the features. 

1. Input a homework assignment.
2. Create a grocery list.
3. View the calendar.

Using these tasks, I conducted a prototype test in order to get a sense of an actual user's flow, in which I garnered some helpful feedback to improve the design.

### high-fidelity prototype

Based off of the ideas and feedback from the low-fidelity prototype, I designed a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. This allowed me to visualize the application in a tangible format that imitated the product's functions and features. It also provided a concrete way to test the product with actual users, and to recieve feedback. 

This prototype visualizes the original features and demonstrates possible tasks. 

1. Adding a new task.
2. Adding a new list.
3. Viewing tasks in a calendar format.
